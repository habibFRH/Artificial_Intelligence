### **3. Projects List**

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

#### **1. Neural Network from Scratch**
- A simple implementation of a binary classification neural network using logistic regression and gradient descent.
  
#### **2. Decision Tree Classifier**
- Building a decision tree model to classify data with categorical and numerical features.

#### **3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- A KNN algorithm to classify data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors.

#### **4. Linear Regression**
- A linear regression model to predict continuous variables based on input features using gradient descent optimization.

#### **5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- Implementing a CNN for image classification tasks (e.g., digit recognition using MNIST dataset).

#### **6. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- A text classification project using machine learning models like Naive Bayes or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

*More projects will be added over time!*
